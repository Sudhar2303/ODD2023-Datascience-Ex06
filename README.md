# AIM
To read the given data and perform Feature Transformation process and save the data to a file.

# EXPLANATION
Feature Transformation is a technique by which we can boost our model performance. Feature transformation is a mathematical transformation in which we apply a mathematical formula to a particular column(feature) and transform the values which are useful for our further analysis.
